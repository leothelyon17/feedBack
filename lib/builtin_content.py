"""Builtin content seeding: the calibration/diagnostic sloppaks and the starter library.

Carved VERBATIM out of server.py (R3b) — with ONE deliberate signature change, and it is
the whole reason this module is safe.

━━━ WHY THE ROOT IS A PARAMETER ━━━

server.py had `_feedBack_server_root()` = `Path(__file__).resolve().parent`. That is
correct *in server.py*: the repo root in dev, resources/feedBack when bundled — the tree
that actually holds docs/ and data/.

Move that body here unchanged and it keeps working, silently, and returns `lib/`. There is
no docs/diagnostics under lib/, so every seed would quietly find nothing and log "source
missing" — a verbatim move whose meaning changed because `__file__` did. Nothing would
fail; the starter library would just never appear.

So this module CANNOT compute a root: it takes `server_root` as a parameter, and server.py
— the only place that legitimately knows where it lives — passes it in. The trap is now
structurally impossible rather than merely avoided. (_copy_builtin_packs already took the
root this way; the two seed helpers now do too.)

Everything else is byte-identical. `log` is this module's own logger under the same
`feedBack.` hierarchy, and CONFIG_DIR is read late as `appstate.config_dir` — see appstate.py
for why those reads must be late-bound (tests monkeypatch it).

    ``sources`` is a list of ``(dest_name, rel_source)`` pairs; each source is

    bundled). A pack is copied when its destination is missing. Never deletes
    user files; refuses to follow a symlinked seed directory or destination and
    refuses to clobber a non-regular destination (any would let a copy escape
    ``dest_dir`` or destroy user data). Logs and continues on error. ``label``
    prefixes every log line.

    ``update_existing`` controls what happens when a *regular* destination file
    already exists: when True (diagnostic seed) a bundle copy newer than the
    destination refreshes it; when False (one-time starter content) an existing
    file is always left as-is so the user's copy is never overwritten.
