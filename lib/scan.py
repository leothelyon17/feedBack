"""The library scanner: the background scan, its process pool, and the kick/runner
plumbing that serialises passes.

Carved VERBATIM out of server.py (R3b) except the seam reads. Everything shared is read
LATE off appstate — the same contract every module in lib/routers/ uses, and it is not
cosmetic: tests monkeypatch CONFIG_DIR and swap meta_db, so a value captured at import
time would pin the wrong one for the life of the process.

    CONFIG_DIR        -> appstate.config_dir
    meta_db           -> appstate.meta_db
    _default_settings -> appstate.default_settings()
    _stat_for_cache   -> appstate.stat_for_cache()
    _feedBack_server_root() -> appstate.server_root      <- see below

━━━ THE SCAN STATUS IS REBOUND, NOT MUTATED ━━━

`_background_scan` does `global _scan_status; _scan_status = {**INIT, ...}` at every stage
transition. It REPLACES the dict; it does not update it in place. So nothing may hold the
dict by value — a reference captured once goes permanently stale at the first stage change,
and would report "listing" forever while the scan ran to completion.

That is why this module exports `status()`, a getter, and why appstate publishes
`scan_status` as a CALLABLE rather than a dict. appstate.py already says so in a comment;
this is the code that makes it true.

━━━ AND WHY THE SERVER ROOT IS READ, NEVER DERIVED ━━━

`_background_scan` seeds the builtin content, which needs the directory holding server.py.
`Path(__file__).resolve().parent` is correct in server.py and silently WRONG here (it
yields lib/, which has no docs/ or data/) — and it fails by finding nothing rather than by
raising, so the seeds would just quietly never run. server.py publishes the root once, as
appstate.server_root. Read it; never re-derive it.

# ── Directory-signature fast path ─────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# A startup scan globs the whole library twice (*.feedpak, *.wem) and stats every
# file to detect what changed. On a 50k-song library that lives on a slow mount
# (an NTFS-3G FUSE volume here) it is ~100k filesystem round trips every launch —
# the "big drive churns on every startup" report.
#
# But adds / removes / renames of songs all bump the mtime of the DIRECTORY that
# holds them (verified on the target NTFS-3G mount), and so does the addition of
# a subdirectory (a new entry in its parent). So after a scan we record every
# library directory and its mtime; on the next scan we re-stat ONLY those
# directories (a handful, vs 100k file ops). If none changed, the file set is
# unchanged and the whole listing/stat pass is skipped.
#
# The one thing this cannot see is a file edited IN PLACE under the same name —
# that bumps the file's mtime but not its directory's. That is rare for a song
# library (you add and remove packs, you don't rewrite them under the same name),
# and the manual Refresh forces a full scan (force=True) for exactly that case.
